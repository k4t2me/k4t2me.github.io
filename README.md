# S0l Market Testnet Guide

S0l.xyz is an NFT Market built on Solana. It is an important part of the WIND ecosystem. Unlike regular marketplaces, S0L will take community as its core, where artists, developers, and players will get their value and gain benefits. Here I will show you how to use SOL.xyz to buy and sell NFT on the test network.


## Get test token

First, you have to have a Phantom wallet and make sure to have some on testnet. If not, go ![sol faucet](https://solfaucet.com/) to claim a few. Note that you can only collect one at a time,  just collect it again after a 30s interval for sevral times.

## Switch network

First, let's switch the wallet to the test network. Open your phantom wallet, go to settings, select `Change Network` and change the network to testnet.
